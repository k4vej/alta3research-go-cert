This CLI to provides numerous utilities which can emulate the
functionality of other readily available tools - but for one reason or another
those "readily available tools" are not so..... readily available.
For example if you are operating in a restricted environment which doesn't have
open access to obtain or install aforementioned "readily available tools",
thus providing a poor mans (or womans, or non-binary or both) alternative.
	
In all likelyhood the functionality you really want is unlikely to be emulated,
hence the name swisscheese - a tool which is full of holes.... like the cheese.

Please enjoy this minimum set of uselessness:
- DNS resolution
- TCP socket client
- TCP socket server
- CPU info output
